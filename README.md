Project Description: Movie Genre Classification and Clustering
Overview
The project aims to analyze and classify movies based on their genres and average ratings. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the project involves data preprocessing, clustering, and classification to derive insights from the movie dataset. The primary goal is to group similar movies and predict their genres based on available features.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing:

Load and clean the dataset.
One-hot encode the genres for easier analysis.
Standardize the feature set for clustering and classification.
Clustering Analysis:

Apply K-Means clustering to group movies into distinct clusters based on genres and average ratings.
Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Classification:

Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict movie genres based on the standardized features.
Evaluate the classifier's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset, merged.csv, contains information about movies, including:

Genres: The categories a movie belongs to (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
Average Rating: The average rating a movie has received from users.
Methodology
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
One-hot encode the genres column to convert categorical data into numerical format.
Combine the encoded genres with the avg_rating column to form the feature set.
Standardize the features using StandardScaler to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Clustering:

Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm on the standardized features.
Use the Elbow Method by plotting the inertia values for different numbers of clusters to identify the optimal number of clusters.
Analyze the resulting clusters to understand the grouping of movies.
Classification:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Random Forest Classifier on the training data.
Predict the genres on the test data and evaluate the model's performance using a classification report.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Programming language used for the implementation.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for clustering and classification.
Matplotlib: Plotting library for visualizing the Elbow Method.
Expected Outcomes
Clusters of Movies: Group movies into clusters where each cluster contains movies with similar genres and average ratings.
Genre Prediction Model: A trained Random Forest Classifier that can predict the genre of a movie based on its features.
Insights: Understand the distribution and relationship between different genres and average ratings of movies.



Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify and cluster movies based on their genres and average ratings. The approach provides a method for organizing and understanding large movie datasets, which can be useful for recommendation systems and market analysis in the entertainment industry.
